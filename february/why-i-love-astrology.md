i love astology because it acknowledges the participatory role in life we all play  
participation in relation to other people to be sure  
but more grandly, more basically, our participation to celestial bodies; the one we are born on and those other ones in our solar system  
i love astrology because it allows for meaning-making  
it encourages people to think grander  
but also to pay closer attention to the smaller things  
to be more sensitive, regardless of scale  
i love astrology because when you start to interact with your chart, you recover a sense of wonder in the face of your own learned skepticism  
rationalism can exist in the way you want it to  
the patterns you recognize are true, and when held together with those of others, in a community, the beauty of these refracted points of view become clear  
to notice the subtleties and to be equipped with a language with which to describe them is beautiful  
regardless of if these things are probable or not, they are real and they are fun  
they exist if i say they do and they are confirmed by those around me  
what people tend to miss when critizizing astrology is the collaboative nature of it  
it is not claiming to be universal and objective  
or at least, i dont think that should be one of the defenses of it  
that argument appeals to a certain kind of imagination, already resticting itself using rational patterns of thought and the desire for universality in the first place  
everything in astrology is relative  
the patterns and associations, when broken down, are a matter of things in relationship to one another  
astrology solely describes our solar system, of course it is not universal  
not to mention the numerous forms of astrology from various cultures  
astrology grounds you in the reality that much of life is unknowable, but that the human instinct to create meaning regardless should be respected and given into
attempting to align your soul and spirit with hard science is not only soul crushing, crazy-making, and borderline egotistical, but in itself an illusion  
the illusion of science's capacity to "know" without question, despite the looming paradox of the origins of scientific thought in the first place  
the unknowable question of the origins of life  
science will not be able to come to terms with this question until it realizes its own bias  
this attempted domination over the universe should be considered blasphemous in all honesty
